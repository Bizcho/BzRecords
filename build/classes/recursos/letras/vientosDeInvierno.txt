And who are you? 
The proud Lord said 
That I must bow so low? 

Only a cat of a differtent coat 
That's all the truth I know. 

In a coat of gold 
Or a coat of red 
A lion still has claws 

And mine are long 
And sharp, my Lord 
As long and sharp as yours. 

And so he spoke 
And so he spoke 
That Lord of Castamere 

But now the rains 
Weep o'er his hall 
With no one there to hear. 

Yes now the rains 
Weep o'er his hall 
And not a soul to hear 

-Music- 

And so he spoke 
And so he spoke 
That Lord of Castamere 

But now the rains 
Weep o'er his hall 
With no one there to hear. 

Yes now the rains 
Weep o'er his hall 
And not a soul to hear
